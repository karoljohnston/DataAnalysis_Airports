# DataAnalysis - Airports by Karol Johnston

Hi all! I'm starting my first personal self led data analysis on something that I really love - aviation. 
I am planning to make real life data analysis and data visualizations that can help airlines and airports solve problems. 
Not sure how long this will take me to finish but I am definitely commited to do this and will keep this repo updated everyday

<b> Day 1 (04/05/2023) </b> - I am looking for the right dataset for my project. There's no where in the internet with the dataset that I was visualizing in my head but I am flexible and work on the datasets that I have gathered for now. <br>
Dataset sources: <br>
• https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ourairports-usa <br>
• https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=usairports <br>
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/us-airports <br>
I will study them tonight on how to integrate the data.
