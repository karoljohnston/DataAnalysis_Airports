# Data Analysis - Airports by Karol Johnston

Hi all! I'm starting my first personal self led data analysis on something that I really love - aviation. 
I am planning to make real life data analysis and data visualizations that can help airlines and airports solve problems. 
Not sure how long this will take me to finish but I am definitely commited to do this and will keep this repo updated everyday

<b> Day 1 (04/05/2023) </b> - I am looking for the right dataset for my project. There's no where in the internet with the dataset that I was visualizing in my head but I am flexible and work on the datasets that I have gathered for now. <br>
Dataset sources: <br>
• https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ourairports-usa <br>
• https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=usairports <br>
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/us-airports <br>
I will study them tonight on how to integrate the data.

<b> Day 2 (04/06/2023) </b> - Today I have made a folder of the original datasets that I have gathered last night. Click <a href="https://github.com/karoljohnston/DataAnalysis_Airports/tree/main/original_datasets">here</a><br>
I have downloaded more dataset if I chose to make an analysis more specific in my location (Las Vegas). <br>
Data sources: <br>
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay<br>
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catsudon/las-flight-arrivals-2019<br>
I looked at ways to create metrics from the raw data using PowerBI. I have cleaned the data using PowerQuery - deleted unnecessary data, removed duplicates, and filled empty cells with appropriate/correct data (e.g. Airport was missing its IATA code) then I have connected two datas together - general airport information and airports with airline and delays dataset
